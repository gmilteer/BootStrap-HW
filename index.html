                    <p>Hi! My name is Georgia Milteer. I am the middle child in my family. I have an older bother and younger brother. I also have a nephew who is 10 months older than my son. My son's name is Haiden and he is 23 months old. I spend a majority of my time working, spending time with family, and friends. I have a business background and I wanted to broaden my web development skills. Pictured to the right, is me, my boyfriend, and my son last yearin Destin,FL on our yearly family vaction. My story starts in Honolulu, Hawaii where I was born. I grew up in a miltary family. My Dad got orders to Georgia when I was 3 and we've been in Georgia ever since. The place we lived the longest in Georgia is Warner Robins. I gratuated from Warner Robins High School in 2010. I then moved to Kennesaw to attend Kennesaw State University, transferred to Georgia State one year later, and finished up my Bachelor degree with Park University. </p>

                <p>After gratuating from Park University, I worked at Enterprise as a Car Sales Associate. After 2 years working there, I got my current position with <span class="Job">Inspection Management(AiM)</span> as a <span class="Job">Dispatch Logistic Coordinator</span>. I've realized that my current position isn't something I want to do forever. I want to gain my skills in web development and see where my new skils take me.</p>
